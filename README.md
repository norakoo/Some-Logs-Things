# Some Logs Things

I didn't have a good title for this repository but i guess it's enough to be explicit lmao

That's the first "project" I did in C++ during my first year in BTS CIEL IR.

Im gonna, in the future, post a lot of repositories on my GitHub account during the whole first and second year.

## Why I'm doing that?

I do it for myself mostly.

To not forget what i learnt, and i'll put other projects too, like my own project.

It is for professional purpose too, like that im able to share some projects i did in the year to show what im capable of doing in multiple language (here in C++ but im learning Python too).

## What I'm globally learning during the first year?

I'm and I'll learn how to do multiple projects, or else in C++ and Python.

I do the same for Markdown (that's how i wrote this README, very basic because there's no need for it to be wonderful lol).

I'll learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript during the year too.

## And Second year?

I still dunno, but probably Java and other languages. Tho I still know some things in Java, mostly thanks to Minecraft.
